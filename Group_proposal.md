# Group proposal

## Introduction: 
__(Eva can put the intro in here)__

* What's CRC (colorectal cancer) 
* DNA methylation
* how they're related (cancer and methylation, and CRC in specific)

## Part 1: Why's 
* Why we pick this dataset 
- 2014 - recent 
* other justification 

## Part 2: About the data 
__(maybe Rashedul can edit this part?)__

* Description of the dataset 
    - the three groups (normal ,adenoma, CRC) 
    - the types of data (probes, samples,  how it's generated generated from the array) 
    - details about data files 

## Part 3: the Questions we want to answer 
* Can we identify differential DNA methylation patterns that underlie the progression of CRC? 

## Part 4: Our Approach 
* there are ~ 500K probes, so we will need to limit that
    - looking at important genes + some randomly selected locations 
* other things we might need to do
   - reformatting and cleaning data
   - build a pipeline
