# Great enrichment analysis
Rashedul  
Friday, April 10, 2015  

In this section, we conducted functional enrichment analysis using [GREAT](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/great/public/html/) tool. At first we looked the 34 CGI regions of our experiment that are common in all three pair-wise differential analyses to look at the gene and their funciton that are associated with those 34 CGIs; see [here]() for details. Also we looked at the differentially expressed CGIs at FDR 1e-4 in 'normal_vs_adenoma', 'normal_vs_cancer' and 'adenoma_vs_cancer' using GREAT; the results are [here]().
