This "positions of DMRs" plot says about the distribution and location of CGIs at chromosome level. Here we made the plots of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that are present in our four differential methylation analyses (DMA) excluding 'X' chromosome. We have taken MDR from toptable at FDR FDR 1e-4. The detailed discussion of results can be found [here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/yy_team01_colorectal-cancer_STAT540_2015/tree/master/analysis_reports/06positions_at_DMR) and the R script here [pre-process](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/yy_team01_colorectal-cancer_STAT540_2015/blob/master/rscripts/DMR_positions_at_chr_pre-process.R) and [plot](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/yy_team01_colorectal-cancer_STAT540_2015/blob/master/rscripts/DMR_positions_at_chr_plot.R).
