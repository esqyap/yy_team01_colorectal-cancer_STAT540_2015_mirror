  - pairwise comparisons of sample groups in which the normal group consists of only normal mucosa from healthy individuals
  - pairwise comparisons include normal-H vs. normal-C, normal-H vs. adenoma, normal-H vs. cancer
  - results are visualized with Venn diagram, heatmaps, and stripplots

  - pairwise comparisons of sample groups in which the normal group consists of both normal mucosa from healthy individuals (normal-H) and cancer patients (normal-C)
  - we decided to combine normal-H and normal-C samples into the normal group to avoid unequal sample sizes
  - pairwise comparisons include normal vs. adenoma, normal vs. cancer, and adenoma vs. cancer
  - results are visualized with Venn diagram, heatmaps, and stripplots
